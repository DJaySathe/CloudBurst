NEtworing COnfiguration:

1. Login to the Machine
2. execute sudo virsh list --all   ---->check the 4vms are running
3. sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases default ---> check the Vms have IP (Note, to make sure everything fine, check IP's manually login to each machine as well)
4. Ping the VM's (Ping should work) if not something wrong in assiging IP
5. Applying NAT rules.(Before apply nar rules, u can check if there exist any by executing (sudo iptables -t nat -nL)
	sudo iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp -d <host_IP> --dport 1235 -j DNAT --to-destination <VM1_IP:22
	sudo iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp -d <host_IP> --dport 1236 -j DNAT --to-destination <VM2_IP>:22
	sudo iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp -d <host_IP> --dport 1237 -j DNAT --to-destination  <VM3_IP>:22
	sudo iptables -I FORWARD -m state -d 192.168.122.0/24 --state NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
6. execute below commands on host machine
	  sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
	  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward(need route privilges to execute this)
7. Try to ssh the host machine from your laptop via port 22, its should works
	if not, try to check whether ping is working in both direction
8. Now you should able to ssh to the VM's via Host via and port numbers
9.
